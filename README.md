# cocainebear-leaderboard
If you're looking for an easy way to submit your score to the leaderboard in https://www.cocainebear.movie/game/, you can do so using a simple HTTPS POST request.

On the new examples (keycap & spammy), you no longer have to manually obtain the MD5 hash of your score. The script will do it for you. Just set the `score` variable to your score, and the script will do the rest.

On Keycap's example you will be prompted for text to enter onto the leaderboard, type whatever you want in.

The game is full of console logs, with 162 console logs as of writing this. Use this information to your advantage to improve your gameplay.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
